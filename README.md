# SEED-X
## Examples of Visual De-tokenization
![image](demos/tokenizer.jpg?raw=true)
The reconstruction results of our visual de-tokenizer. It can decode realistic images that are semantically aligned with the original images by taking the ViT features as inputs, and further recover fine-grained details by incorporating the conditional images as inputs.
## Ablation Study
### Visual De-tokenizer
![image](demos/ablation_detokenizer.jpg?raw=true)
We utilize a pre-trained ViT as the visual tokenizer and pre-train a visual de-tokenizer to decode realistic images by taking the features of the ViT as inputs.  Specifically, N visual embeddings (after average pooling) from the ViT tokenizer are fed into a learnable module as the inputs of the U-Net of the pre-trained SD-XL. We perform an ablation study on the number of viual embeddings and the learnable parameters of the SD-XL U-Net, where keys and values within the U-Net are optimized if not specified with "fully fine-tunue". The input images and the reconstructed images from the visual de-tokenizer are shown in the figure below. We can observe that more visual tokens can result in better reconstruction of the original images. For example, the decoded images from 256 visual embeddings can recover the characters' postures of the original images, while decoded images from 32 visual embeddings have already lost the original structure of the scene. We further observe that fully fine-tuning the parameters of the SD-XL U-Net can lead to distortions in image details, such as feet, compared to only training the keys and values within the U-Net. 

### MLLM for Image Generation
![image](demos/ablation_t2i.jpg?raw=true)
To enable MLLM for image generation, we employ N learnable queries to obtain the output visual representations from the LLM, which are trained to reconstruct N visual embeddings from the ViT tokenizer with a learnable module. We first perform an abation study on the number of learnable queries. The images generated by the MLLM based on the input caption are shown in the figure below. We can observe that using 256 learnable queries to reconstruct 256 visual embeddings can lead to distortion in the generated images compared with N = 64. This occurs because regressing more visual features is more challenging for the model, even though 256 visual embeddings from the de-tokenizer can better reconstruct images, as demonstrated in the previous ablation study. We also observe that, compared to learning a one-layer cross-attention for reconstructing image features, a multi-layer resampler (multi-layer cross-attention) yields less satisfactory performance, which can happen due to the lack of more direct regularizations on the hidden states of the LLM. We further optimize the visual de-tokenizer by using the reconstructed visual embeddings from the MLLM as input, but the generated images exhibit a more monotonous appearance. It demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing the ViT Tokenizer as the bridge to decouple the training of visual de-tokenizer and the MLLM for image generation.

### Instruction Tuning
#### Training
1. Prepare the pretrained models including the pre-trained foundation model **SEED-X** and the visual encoder of Qwen-VL-Chat (See Model Weights).
2. Prepare the instruction tuning data. For example, for "build_llava_jsonl_datapipes" dataloader, each folder stores a number of jsonl files, each jsonl file contains 10K pieces of content, with an example of the content as follows:
```bash
{"image": "coco/train2017/000000033471.jpg", "data": ["What are the colors of the bus in the image?", "The bus in the image is white and red.", "What feature can be seen on the back of the bus?", "The back of the bus features an advertisement.", "Is the bus driving down the street or pulled off to the side?", "The bus is driving down the street, which is crowded with people and other vehicles."]}
```

For "build_caption_datapipes_with_pixels" dataloder, each folder stores a number of .tar files and reads image-text pairs in the form of webdataset.

For "build_single_turn_edit_datapipes" dataloder,  each folder stores a number of jsonl files, each jsonl file contains 10K pieces of content, with an example of the content as follows:
```bash
{"source_image": "source_images/f6f4d0669694df5b.jpg", "target_image": "target_images/f6f4d0669694df5b.jpg", "instruction": "Erase the car that is parked in front of the Roebuck building."}
```
3. Run the following script.

```bash
# For general instruction tuning for multimodal comprehension and generation
sh scripts/train_seed_x_sft_comp_gen.sh
```

```bash
# For training language-guided image editing
sh scripts/train_seed_x_sft_edit.sh
```
#### Inference with your own model
1. Obtain "pytorch_model.bin" with the following script.
```bash
cd train_output/seed_x_sft_comp_gen/checkpoint-xxxx
python3 zero_to_fp32.py . pytorch_model.bin
```
2. Change "pretrained_model_path" in "configs/clm_models/agent_seed_x.yaml" with the new checkpoint. For example,
```bash
pretrained_model_path: train_output/seed_x_sft_comp_gen/checkpoint-4000/pytorch_model.bin
```
3. Change the "llm_cfg_path" and "agent_cfg_path" in the inference script (See below), which will automatically load the trained LoRA weights onto the pretrained model SEED-X.
```bash
llm_cfg_path = 'configs/clm_models/llm_seed_x_lora.yaml'
agent_cfg_path = 'configs/clm_models/agent_seed_x.yaml'
```
4. Run the inference script,
```bash
# For image comprehension
python3 src/inference/eval_img2text_seed_x_i.py
# For image generation
python3 src/inference/eval_text2img_seed_x_i.py
# For image editing
python3 src/inference/eval_img2edit_seed_x_edit.py
```
